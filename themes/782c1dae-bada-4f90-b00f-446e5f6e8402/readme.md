This theme contains a few small tweaks for making the tab sidebar more compact:
- Reduce the minimum width of the sidebar while expanded
- Reduce the height of tabs
- Reduce the height of the tab sidebar while in compact mode

Each of these settings can be enabled individually by changing the configuration in the settings page.

Feel free to suggest more features for this theme.
