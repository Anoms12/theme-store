# No browser padding

Another official theme done by Zen's team. Many people requested this feature inside Zen, and now they have it, thanks to this theme!

## What does it do?

It removes the right and bottom margins and border radius of the browser's view, creating a more compact experience for those who want it.

* This theme is intentionally done so that it doesn't apply for split views as it would look a bit weird!

Please submit any issues related to this theme [here](https://github.com/zen-browser/theme-components/issues) instead of Zen's desktop repository.

Hope you like it!
